# Open Labels Initiative: Python Walkthrough
October 16, 1:00 PM - 2:00PM UTC

Hands-on session with the Open Labels Initiative (OLI) — a standard, registry and trust layer for EVM address labels.

​We’ll start with a short intro to the OLI Schema and Label Pool, then walk through how to use the oli-python tools to fetch, create and upload labels. You will learn how to query existing label data, contribute new labels and publish them to the shared OLI Label Pool. Perfect for developers, data analysts and explorers interested in open, community owned labels.
